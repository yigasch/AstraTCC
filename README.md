# 🧠 Astra — Personal Well-Being Support App
Astra is an intuitive mobile application designed to support emotional well-being and daily life needs, especially for individuals with neuropsychological differences or difficulties. 
This project was developed as our **Final Year Computing Technical Degree Project** by me and my classmates.

We built Astra to help people better understand and manage emotions, feel more connected to themselves and the world around them, and reduce the stigma associated with mental health by encouraging **comprehension, empathy, and acceptance.**

## 🌟 About Astra
Astra is more than a productivity or mindfulness tool — it’s a companion for emotional care. 
It offers helpful and practical resources for daily life, including:
-  Reminders — stay on top of routines
-  Guided Meditations — for calm and focus
-  Mood Tracker — log how you feel over time

## 💻 What I Learned
During this project, we developed not only technical skills, but also a deeper understanding of how technology can be used responsibly and empathetically. Building Astra pushed us to think beyond functionality and focus on people, emotions, and accessibility.

### 🧠 User-Centered & Inclusive Design
I learned how to design emotionally safe and accessible interfaces by focusing on simplicity, clear communication, and reduced cognitive overload, especially for users with neuropsychological differences.

### 📱 Progressive Web App (PWA) Development
I learned how to transform a traditional web application into a Progressive Web App, making it installable and usable offline, while understanding how service workers and web app manifests contribute to performance, accessibility, and a mobile-first experience.

### 🐾 Virtual Pet & Emotional Feedback
I learned how to translate abstract emotional states into visual and interactive feedback through the virtual pet, using gentle gamification to motivate self-care without creating pressure, guilt, or judgment.

### 📔 Handling Emotional Data Responsibly
I learned the importance of handling emotional data with care, prioritizing user privacy and trust, and understanding how design decisions can directly impact how safe users feel when expressing their emotions.

### 🧩 Application Architecture & Feature Integration
I learned how to structure features in a way that allows the application to grow gradually while remaining intuitive, constantly evaluating whether each feature added real value or unnecessary complexity.

### 🤝 Teamwork & Collaboration
I learned how to collaborate effectively in a group project by communicating ideas clearly, dividing responsibilities, and using version control tools to work together efficiently.

### 📈 Overall Growth
This project taught us that building software is not just about writing code — it’s about understanding people, making thoughtful decisions, and creating tools that genuinely support users. Astra was an opportunity to combine technical knowledge, research, empathy, and creativity into a meaningful product.

## 💭 Future Improvements
Here are ideas we hope to build next:
- Smart reminders powered by user behavior
- Mood trend analytics
- Social sharing & support groups
